I used to think that I was made of stone
I only wanted to go on my own
It gets so lonely when you're all alone
And you just can't take anymore

Look at the passion in my eyes tonight
Coming at you through the cool moonlight
I want a lover who can hold on tight
Till I just can't take anymore

Give me the heavenly night
Make you the devil in a fast car
Serve me no angel in white
I want you just the way that you are

Heard their eyes are watching everywhere
Try not to catch us but I just don't care
I've got to touch you just to prove you're there
Not some dream that I had before

Here comes that feeling that I can't understand
Can't put it in the bank, can't hold it in my hand
Gambled a lifetime on a one-night-stand
Just to see what lies in store

Give me the heavenly night
Make you the devil in a fast car
Serve me no angel in white
I want you just the way that you are

Give me the heavenly night
Make you the devil in a fast car
Serve me no angel in white
I want you just the way that you are

Flying east to the rising sun
For ninety minutes I'll be under the gun
I'll dream about you while I'm on the run
Till I just can't dream anymore

Give me the heavenly night
Make you the devil in a fast car
Serve me no angel in white
I want you just the way that you are

Give me the heavenly night
Make you the devil in a fast car
Serve me no angel in white
I want you just the way that you are

Give me the heavenly night
Make you the devil in a fast car
Serve me no angel in white
I want you just the way that you are

Give me the heavenly night
Make you the devil in a fast car
Serve me no angel in white
I want you just the way that you are.
